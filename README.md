## Interpretation for Histogram:
### The histogram of 'fuelType' displays the frequency distribution of different fuel types in the dataset. 
### Since 'fuelType' is likely a categorical feature (e.g., 'Petrol', 'Diesel'), this histogram visualizes the count of each fuel type.
### If the histogram shows a peak, it indicates the most common fuel type in the dataset. 
### This information can help us understand the distribution of vehicle types in the dataset, which could be relevant for analyzing fuel-related patterns.

## Interpretation for Heatmap:
### The heatmap illustrates the correlation between numeric features in the dataset.
### Strong positive correlations may be observed between variables such as 'engine_size' and 'fuel_consumption'.
### This suggests that as the engine size increases, fuel consumption tends to increase, which aligns with expectations.
### Additionally, if a negative correlation is noted between 'fuel_efficiency' and 'vehicle_weight', it indicates that heavier vehicles generally have lower fuel efficiency.
### These insights are valuable for understanding feature relationships and can guide feature selection and modeling strategies in AI applications.
